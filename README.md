##Instructions for processing and plotting ctd data task

The "Data" folder within this repository contains a file with the name "SBE19plus_01908365_2025_10_15.cnv" obtained from a Seabird CTD instrument.
This instrument measures variables such as salinity, temperature, fluorescence, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen at programmed intervals. Seabird stores this data in a proprietary format with the extension "*.cnv", which is both human-readable and handled easily with the R package "oce".
This particular CTD was deployed on one of our benthic landers for a period of 14 months from August 2024 - October 2025. The CTD was programmed to take a measurements every 2 hours while positioned near a deep-sea coral habitat at approx. 1050 meters deep. The time series we have collected will be used to understand oceanographic patterns that control important ecological processes like food supply and physical dynamics in seafloor habitats.
